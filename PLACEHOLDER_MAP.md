Notes

- If you'd like me to replace any placeholder with a real value or image file, reply with a mapping like:
  [SITE-NAME-01] = "Ariel Mella"  (APPLIED)
  [CONTACT-01] = "example.com"    (APPLIED)
  [ORG-01] = "Ariel Mella / Org" (APPLIED)

- I can also produce a small pull request with each replacement as a separate commit for review.
